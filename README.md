# dna-origami-autoencoder
A groundbreaking "wet-lab ML" framework that encodes 8-bit images into self-assembling DNA origami structures and decodes them using transformer models trained on simulated base-pair kinetics. This project bridges synthetic biology and machine learning to demonstrate information storage and retrieval through biological self-assembly.
