# Safety Guidelines for DNA-Origami-AutoEncoder

## Overview
This document provides essential safety guidelines for working with the DNA-Origami-AutoEncoder project. While this is primarily a computational project, it interfaces with synthetic biology and molecular systems requiring careful consideration of safety practices.

## Computational Safety

### Data Security
- **Sensitive Data**: Never commit API keys, credentials, or proprietary sequences to version control
- **Local Environment**: Use `.env` files for configuration (already in `.gitignore`)
- **Network Security**: Validate all external data sources and API endpoints
- **Dependencies**: Regularly audit and update dependencies for security vulnerabilities

### Code Safety
- **Input Validation**: All DNA sequences and image data must be validated before processing
- **Memory Management**: Large molecular simulations can consume significant memory
- **Resource Limits**: Implement timeouts and resource limits for long-running simulations
- **Error Handling**: Fail safely and provide clear error messages

## Biological Safety

### Synthetic Biology Considerations
This project deals with DNA sequence design and may generate sequences for laboratory synthesis:

#### DNA Sequence Safety
- **Pathogen Screening**: All generated DNA sequences should be screened against pathogen databases
- **Restricted Sequences**: Avoid generating sequences that could encode harmful proteins
- **Dual-Use Research**: Be aware of potential dual-use applications of DNA storage technology
- **Ethics Review**: Consider institutional review for research involving DNA synthesis

#### Laboratory Integration
When integrating with wet-lab protocols:

- **Biosafety Level**: Follow appropriate biosafety containment (typically BSL-1 for non-pathogenic DNA)
- **Personal Protective Equipment**: Use appropriate PPE when handling DNA samples
- **Waste Disposal**: Follow institutional guidelines for biological waste disposal
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records of all synthesized sequences

## Research Ethics

### Open Science
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure all research can be independently reproduced
- **Data Sharing**: Follow FAIR data principles while respecting privacy
- **Publication**: Follow proper attribution and citation practices
- **Collaboration**: Respect intellectual property and collaboration agreements

### Responsible AI
- **Bias**: Monitor for bias in neural network training and predictions
- **Transparency**: Provide interpretable AI decisions where possible
- **Robustness**: Test models under diverse conditions and edge cases
- **Fairness**: Ensure equal access to tools and opportunities

## Environmental Considerations

### Computational Environmental Impact
- **Energy Efficiency**: Optimize code for energy-efficient computation
- **Cloud Usage**: Choose cloud providers with renewable energy commitments
- **GPU Utilization**: Maximize GPU efficiency to reduce carbon footprint
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Prefer efficient algorithms over brute-force approaches

### Biological Environmental Impact
- **Biodegradability**: DNA-based storage systems are naturally biodegradable
- **Containment**: Ensure proper containment of synthetic biological systems
- **Release Prevention**: Prevent accidental release of designed sequences
- **Impact Assessment**: Consider ecological impact of scaled implementations

## Regulatory Compliance

### International Guidelines
- **Export Controls**: Be aware of export control regulations for biotechnology
- **Patents**: Respect existing patents in DNA nanotechnology and storage
- **Standards**: Follow emerging standards for DNA data storage (IEEE, ISO)
- **Reporting**: Report significant safety incidents to appropriate authorities

### Institutional Requirements
- **IRB Approval**: Seek Institutional Review Board approval for human-related research
- **IBC Oversight**: Engage Institutional Biosafety Committee for biological research
- **Animal Welfare**: Follow animal welfare guidelines if applicable
- **Student Training**: Ensure proper safety training for all project participants

## Emergency Procedures

### Computational Emergencies
- **Data Breach**: Follow institutional data breach protocols
- **System Compromise**: Isolate affected systems and notify IT security
- **Data Loss**: Implement regular backups and recovery procedures
- **Service Outage**: Maintain communication channels and status updates

### Laboratory Emergencies
- **Exposure**: Follow institutional exposure protocols
- **Spills**: Clean up biological spills according to safety protocols
