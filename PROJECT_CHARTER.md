## Problem Statement

Current digital storage systems face fundamental physical limitations in density, longevity, and energy consumption. DNA offers theoretical storage densities of 1 exabyte per cubic millimeter and stability measured in millennia, but existing DNA storage methods lack:

2. **Direct Readability**: Current methods require full DNA sequencing for data retrieval
3. **Error Resilience**: Limited error correction capabilities for degraded biological samples
4. **Wet-Lab Integration**: No standardized pipeline from digital data to physical DNA structures

## Vision Statement

**"Create the world's first practical biological information storage system that combines DNA origami self-assembly with machine learning to achieve ultra-dense, long-term data storage with direct optical readout capabilities."**
