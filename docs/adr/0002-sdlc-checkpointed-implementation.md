# ADR-0002: Checkpointed SDLC Implementation Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The DNA-Origami-AutoEncoder project requires a comprehensive Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) implementation to support enterprise-grade development, deployment, and maintenance. Given GitHub App permission limitations and the need for reliable progress tracking, a checkpointed strategy is required.

## Decision
We will implement SDLC components using a checkpoint-based approach where:

1. **Checkpoint Strategy**: Break implementation into 8 discrete checkpoints
2. **Sequential Execution**: Complete one checkpoint before proceeding to the next
3. **Permission Handling**: Document manual setup requirements when GitHub App lacks permissions
4. **Progress Tracking**: Commit and push each checkpoint independently
5. **Validation**: Ensure each checkpoint is complete and functional

### Checkpoint Breakdown:
1. **Foundation & Documentation**: Project structure, community files, ADRs
2. **Development Environment**: Tooling, linting, formatting, IDE configuration
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Framework setup, coverage, performance testing
4. **Build & Containerization**: Docker, CI/CD foundations, security baseline
5. **Monitoring & Observability**: Health checks, logging, metrics configuration
6. **Workflow Documentation**: CI/CD templates, security scanning procedures
7. **Metrics & Automation**: Repository health, automated maintenance scripts
8. **Integration & Configuration**: Final setup, repository settings, documentation

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Reliable Progress**: Each checkpoint can be completed independently
- **Permission Resilience**: Can document manual requirements instead of failing
- **Incremental Value**: Each checkpoint adds immediate value
- **Review Friendly**: Small, focused changes are easier to review
- **Rollback Capability**: Can revert individual checkpoints if needed

### Negative
- **Multiple Commits**: Results in more commits than a single large implementation
- **Context Switching**: Requires switching between different SDLC aspects
- **Coordination Overhead**: Need to track checkpoint dependencies

### Neutral
- **Documentation Heavy**: Extensive documentation required for manual setup steps
- **Branch Management**: Multiple checkpoint branches require careful management

## Implementation Notes
- Each checkpoint will be implemented on the `terragon/implement-checkpointed-sdlc-esrhoh` branch
- Manual setup requirements will be documented in `docs/SETUP_REQUIRED.md`
- All configuration changes will preserve existing working setups
- Repository maintainers must complete manual steps due to GitHub App limitations

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Single Large Implementation**: Rejected due to permission issues and difficulty tracking progress
2. **Feature-Based Branches**: Rejected due to complexity of merging interdependent changes
3. **Manual Setup Only**: Rejected as it doesn't provide automated value
