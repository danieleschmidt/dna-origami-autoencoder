# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status
Template

## Context
We need a standardized format for documenting architectural decisions in the DNA-Origami-AutoEncoder project. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) help track the reasoning behind technical choices and provide historical context for future development.

## Decision
We will use this template for all architectural decisions. Each ADR should:

1. Have a unique sequential number
2. Use a descriptive title
3. Include status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
4. Document context, decision, and consequences

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved decision traceability
- Better onboarding for new team members
- Historical context preservation
- Structured decision-making process

### Negative
- Additional documentation overhead
- Requires discipline to maintain

## Template Format

Use this template for new ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYYY]

## Context
[Describe the situation and problem that led to this decision]

## Decision
[Describe the decision made and rationale]

## Consequences
[Describe the positive and negative consequences of this decision]

### Positive
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

### Negative
- [Drawback 1]
- [Drawback 2]

## Notes
[Any additional notes, references, or future considerations]
```

## Notes
This template is based on Michael Nygard's ADR format and adapted for scientific software development contexts.
