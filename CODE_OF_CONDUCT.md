# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Supporting open science and reproducible research practices
* Encouraging collaboration across disciplines and institutions
* Respecting the ethical implications of biological and computational research

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Misuse of research data or violation of data sharing agreements
* Plagiarism or misrepresentation of research contributions
* Violation of biosafety protocols or ethical research guidelines
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to:
* Research collaborations and data sharing agreements
* Conference presentations and publications
* Peer review activities
* Educational and training activities
* Industry partnerships and commercial applications

## Scientific Integrity

As a research-focused community, we are committed to maintaining the highest
standards of scientific integrity:

### Research Ethics
* All research must comply with relevant ethical guidelines and institutional approvals
* Proper attribution must be given to all contributors and data sources
* Research data should be made available according to FAIR principles when possible
* Conflicts of interest must be disclosed transparently

### Biosafety and Responsible Research
* All biological research must follow appropriate biosafety protocols
* Dual-use research concerns must be discussed and addressed appropriately
* Environmental and safety implications of DNA nanotechnology must be considered
* Responsible innovation principles should guide technology development

### Open Science Practices
* Code and data should be made openly available when possible
* Research methods should be documented clearly for reproducibility
* Negative results and failed experiments should be shared when appropriate
* Collaborative research should benefit all participating parties fairly

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.

For research ethics concerns, additional reporting can be made to:
* Institutional Review Board at affiliated institutions
* Research integrity officers
* Professional society ethics committees
* Funding agency research integrity offices

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Research-Specific Enforcement

For research integrity violations:

### 1. Data Correction
**Violation**: Minor errors in data reporting or insufficient documentation
**Consequence**: Required correction of data/documentation with community notification

### 2. Research Probation
**Violation**: Significant methodology issues or failure to follow research protocols
**Consequence**: Temporary restriction from lead authorship pending remediation

### 3. Collaboration Suspension
**Violation**: Serious breaches of research ethics or repeated violations
**Consequence**: Suspension from collaborative research activities and access to shared resources

### 4. Community Exclusion
**Violation**: Major research misconduct or safety violations
**Consequence**: Permanent exclusion from community research activities and resources

## Appeal Process

Any person subject to enforcement action may appeal the decision by:
1. Submitting a written appeal within 30 days of the enforcement decision
2. Providing additional context or evidence for consideration
3. Requesting review by an independent panel of community members
4. Accepting the final decision of the appeal review

Appeals will be reviewed within 30 days by a panel of 3-5 community members
not involved in the original enforcement decision.

## Recognition and Attribution

We recognize that research is collaborative and seek to ensure appropriate
attribution:

* Contributions to code, data, and research should be acknowledged appropriately
* Authorship decisions should follow disciplinary standards and be discussed openly
* Community contributions should be recognized in project documentation
* Educational and mentoring activities should be valued and acknowledged
